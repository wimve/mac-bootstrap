# Jump-start my Mac with Ansible

# Why ?

Because I can! And most of all because Ansible is more fun than spending your
afternoon clicking installers.

## How ?

Just run `sh work.sh` on the professional account and `sh personal.sh` on the
not so professional one. After that `scripts/install-requirements.sh` will make
sure you're all set by installing Command Line Tools, Homebrew and Ansible.
Finally it runs the corresponding playbook to perform it's ✨magic✨.
